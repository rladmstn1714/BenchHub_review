Subject Type: Explain what the query is about (e.g., the main topic or subject of the question). Consider the query itself, its answer, and its original category to determine the subject accurately.
Task Type: Identify the type of ability or skill required to solve the query (e.g., reasoning, background knowledge, critical thinking, calculation, etc.). Base your analysis on the nature of the query and the reasoning process needed to reach the answer.
Target Type: Determine whether the query pertains to a specific culture, domain, or context, or if it is more general and universally applicable. Use all available metadata (query, answer, category) to make this judgment.

Provide a comprehensive and well-reasoned explanation for each category to clearly describe the nature of the query.
