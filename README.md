## Usage

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

# load the pretrained model
pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("Cicici1109/IEAP", trust_remote_code=True)

# generate an image with the model
generated_image = pipeline(
    image_path="assets/a12.jpg",
    editing_instructions="Change the action of the woman to running and minify the woman."
)

# display the generated image
generated_image.show()
```
